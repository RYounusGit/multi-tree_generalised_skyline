# multi-tree_generalised_skyline
This repository contains an extension to the generalised skyline plot, dubbed the multi-tree generalised skyline plot. This was intended for use in a Part III Systems Biology research project with the Durbin group.

This repository contains a script for an extension to generalised skyline plot, the multi-tree generalised skyline plot. This extension allows for the incorporation of multiple trees from a population and uses them to create a sklyine for the effective population size over time.
This was developed for a Part III Systems Biology research project with Richard Durbin. The supplied code has not been tailored for public use, so it is quite messy and requires minor modifications for use outside of this project.
